<p>
	These are some projects I've enjoyed working on. The list is quite short as of now, but I plan to change that soon!
</p>

<h2> Spawn </h2>
<p>
	Spawn is a game created by me and Steven Mai. You can download it from the Google Play Store <a
		href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StevenAndHoward.Spawn">here</a>. It's now played in more
	than 10 countries across the world!
</p>

<h2> Game-Playing Neural Net </h2>
<p>
	Inspired by <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/">AlphaGo</a>, I made an AI that plays Connect Four and
	Tic-Tac-Toe. You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/howard36/Game-Playing-Neural-Net">on Github</a>.
</p>

<h2> Particle Simulator </h2>
<p>
	I wrote a program that simulates the motion of particles under the influence of gravity. Here are some pictures of it
	in action:
